# Yggoo

Yggoo — **Ypperlige Gode Gaver Omsorgsfuldt Opfundet** — is a small Danish online gift shop selling handmade items at affordable prices. The product catalog includes rings, games, and assorted crafts, priced between 5–69 kr. Orders and payments are handled directly through Hedvig (hedvig@yggoo.dk).

The site is built with Nuxt 4, styled with Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS, and protected by nuxt-security. An admin panel at `/admin` is gated behind HTTP Basic Auth.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Admin credentials default to `admin` / `admin` (configured in `nuxt.config.ts`).
